# Latte
Latte is a modular, object-oriented, and class-based UI framework, meant to be used in production for Roblox experiences.

## Latte is not a replacement of Roact
Latte does not have anything such as an actual render like Roact, it is only a simple UI framework that follows the philosophy of modular, objects and classes, so you can write better code for your UI.

## Get started
To use Latte, you need to have the latest installation of Rojo, which can be done by visiting [rojo.space](https://rojo.space). After that, simply just build this project with `rojo build` and open it in Studio.
